Problem 1B
----------

/* Fix me */
Total Execution of the following CPUs:
1 CPU: 67.6 sec
2 CPU: 35.8 sec
4 CPU: 33.1 sec
There is no linear relationship between the number of CPUs and the total execution time.
The execution time improves, i.e. the ececution time decreases when going from 1 CPU to
2 CPUs to 4 CPUs. A decreased execution time is observed whenever the number are CPUs are
increased. However, only a slight decrease in execution time is observed everytime we
decrease the number of CPUs. As the number of CPUs increase, we observe less improvements
in execution time because a process with a long CPU burst will hold up other processes
hurting the overall throughput since the I/O on processes in waiting state may complete
while the CPU bound process is still running.


Problem 2B
----------

/* Fix me */
B.1: It is not possible to precisely implement an LRTF algorithm because its impossile to
predict the exact time of CPU bursts, we can only estimate the burst times of CPUs - which
makes it essentially impossible to implement an LRTF algorithm.

B.2: 
Total Waiting Times:
FIFO (1 CPU): 390.2 sec
LRTF (1 CPU): 280.3 sec

LRTF has the lowest waiting time. This is because LRTF prioritizes the longer running
processes first making sure the effect of convoy effect is eliminated - decreasing the
waiting time for LRTF.

Problem 3B
----------

/* Fix me */
Waiting Times for Round Robin Algorithm
RoundRobin (1 CPU) 800 ms Timeslice: 325.4 sec
RoundRobin (1 CPU) 600 ms Timeslice: 314.5 sec
RoundRobin (1 CPU) 400 ms Timeslice: 298.8 sec
RoundRobin (1 CPU) 200 ms Timeslice: 285.2 sec

The total waiting time decreases with shorter timeslices. As timeslices decreases, the
total number of context switches increases. In a real OS, having a large number of context
switches is not practical since you would be switching a constantly.
